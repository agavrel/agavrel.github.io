"Reviews": "'I was able to work with Antonin on a marketplace creation project at Engie. Critical project of global scope on a very specific vertical (utilities). Antonin has proven to be a developer who quickly understands the issues, who gains in skill extremely quickly and happily leaves his comfort zone. He was able to work with many amazon web services (cloud) and python language bricks (s3 storage, elasticsearch, postgre rds). Integrated into the team in a few hours, Antonin in addition to quickly understanding and well coded is nice and has humor (including himself and his job) which does not spoil anything, quite the contrary! I can only recommend his services!' - Aissa Belaid, (Former) Engie CTO\n\n'Antonin has solid low-level tech skills and is a passionate about software engineering. I found he was always working to improve agile process and introduce tools to drive quality and output.

Antonin was committed and driven at work, easy-going and warm-hearted in person and was always ready to help. He was a source of inspiration to those around him. I strongly recommend Antonin for his excellent technical abilities and interpersonal skills.' - Elies Sekouri, Developer/Technical Architect at Societe Generale Corporate Investment Banking\n\n'I took Antonin's courses \"C# Applied to Finance Usecases\" as well as \"VBA\" as a master 2 student of Statistic and Financial Engineering, a selective program at Paris II University. The course was a great combination of financial knowledge and algorithms. Antonin's unique way of teaching, which emphasized on practical problem-solving, helped me develop solid skills in C# and VBA while having fun along the way. Despite the different beginning skill levels of 30+ students, Antonin ensured everyone's maximum growth through individualized attention and his generosity of time.
