I have been coding since I am 12 years old, enjoying discovering new languages and different topics ranging from Security to Optimization.
I have worked for financial institutions, as a matter of fact I started as a financial analyst and reconverted as a developer and entrepreneur after a short training in the 42 School;
Throughout the years I have successfully contributed to miscellaneous software programs and built my own ones. My latest project is called Haven, a mobile app to efficiently look for the best apartments;
I can either build your desired website and/or mobile app or be hired for short periods with a daily rate of â‚¬570;
